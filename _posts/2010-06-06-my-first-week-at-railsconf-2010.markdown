Tomorrow is my first day as a software apprentice at 8th Light, but I will not be in the office.  Instead, I will be attending this year's RailsConf in Baltimore, Maryland.  My mentor, Micah, told me I still have to write a min-max algorithm for my tic-tac-toe [program](http://skim.la/2010/03/15/tic-tac-toe-in-ruby-and-javascript) so I'll be working on it through out the week.

I will post an update later this week.
